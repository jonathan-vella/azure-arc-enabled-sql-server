# Granular Delegated Admin Privileges (GDAP)

Granular Delegated Admin Privileges (GDAP) is a feature that allows partners to have more granular control over the permissions they have in their customers' Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure Active Directory) tenants. This enables partners to adhere to the principle of least privilege, ensuring they only have the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
